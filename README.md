# open-data-pulse

A small data pipeline that takes a daily snapshot of 21 public feeds: AI research and model hubs, agent frameworks, data-engineering tool releases and adoption, platform status, security advisories, and weather, air and hazards in the cities that host the big cloud regions.

A GitHub Actions job runs it every morning. It fetches the feeds in parallel, retries what fails, writes one date-partitioned JSONL file per feed, records a run manifest, and rebuilds this README.

**Last run:** never

## Pipeline health

_No runs yet._

## How it works

- **One class per feed.** Each source in [`pipeline/sources/`](pipeline/sources) sets its metadata and implements `fetch()`, which returns rows, and `highlight()`, which writes its line in the digest.
- **Failures stay contained.** Sources run in a thread pool, and HTTP calls retry with backoff. A source that still errors is marked `failed` in the manifest while the rest carry on. The job only fails when fewer than half the sources succeed.
- **Idempotent partitions.** Output goes to `data/<source>/dt=<YYYY-MM-DD>/data.jsonl`. Re-running a day overwrites that day's file, so reruns never duplicate rows.
- **Change detection.** A source can read its previous partition. The LLM catalog flags models that weren't there on the last run, and Docker pulls report the change since the last run.
- **Run manifests.** `data/_runs/dt=<YYYY-MM-DD>/manifest.json` records the status, row count, duration and any error for every source.
- **No dependencies.** Python standard library only.

## Query the data

The layout is Hive-style, so [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) reads it in place:

```sql
-- Largest earthquakes across every snapshot
SELECT dt, magnitude, place
FROM read_json_auto('data/earthquakes/*/data.jsonl', hive_partitioning = true)
ORDER BY magnitude DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Models added to the LLM catalog, by day
SELECT dt, count(*) AS new_models, list(name) AS names
FROM read_json_auto('data/llm_catalog/*/data.jsonl', hive_partitioning = true)
WHERE is_new
GROUP BY dt
ORDER BY dt DESC;

-- Daily PyPI downloads for the data stack
SELECT dt, package, last_day
FROM read_json_auto('data/pypi_downloads/*/data.jsonl', hive_partitioning = true)
WHERE package IN ('pyspark', 'polars', 'duckdb')
ORDER BY dt, package;
```

## Run it locally

```bash
python -m pipeline.run                      # every source, today's date
python -m pipeline.run --only earthquakes   # one source
python -m unittest discover tests
```

It needs Python 3.11 or newer. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for higher GitHub API limits. Spark, Kafka and Flink publish tags instead of GitHub releases, and looking those up needs the token.

## Add a source

Subclass `Source` in the matching module under [`pipeline/sources/`](pipeline/sources), implement `fetch()` and `highlight()`, and add an instance to that module's `SOURCES` list.

## Data and licenses

The code is MIT licensed. Each dataset belongs to its publisher and keeps its own terms: arXiv, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, GitHub, npm, PyPI Stats, Docker Hub, DEV, Hacker News (via Algolia), each platform's status page, CISA, Wikimedia, Open-Meteo, USGS, NASA EONET, and the European Central Bank (via Frankfurter). The Sources table links to each one.
